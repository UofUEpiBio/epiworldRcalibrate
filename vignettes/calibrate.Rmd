# Introduction

This vignette introduces the `simulate_calibrate_sir` function, which simulates and calibrates an SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model using TensorFlow and Keras in R. The function is designed to generate simulated epidemic data, train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and evaluate the model's performance using the simulated data.

The vignette guides you through the different stages of the function, including data generation, simulation, model building, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the following libraries are installed and loaded:

```{r}
library(epiworldRcalibrate)
library(keras3)
library(data.table)
library(tensorflow)
library(reticulate)
library()
```

# Function Overview

The `simulate_calibrate_sir` function performs the following key tasks:

1.  **Generate Theta and Seeds:** Randomly generate model parameters and simulation seeds.
2.  **Run Simulations:** Simulate epidemic trajectories based on the generated parameters.
3.  **Prepare Data for Training:** Organize the simulated data to prepare it for training a CNN model.
4.  **Split Data:** Split the data into training and testing sets.
5.  **Build and Train the Model:** Build a CNN model and train it on the training data.
6.  **Evaluate the Model:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test data.

The function's arguments are:

-   `N`: Number of simulation runs.
-   `n`: Number of population.
-   `ndays`: Number of days to run the simulation.
-   `ncores`: Number of cores used for parallel processing.

# Step-by-Step Walkthrough

## 1. Generate Theta and Seeds

The first step in the function is to generate the parameter sets (`theta`) and random seeds for the simulation:

```{r}
N=2e4
n=5000
theta <- generate_theta(N, n)
head(theta,5)
```

```{r}
seeds <- sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, N, TRUE)
head(seeds,5)
```

-   `generate_theta()`: Generates random parameters for the SIR model.
-   `seeds`: Random seeds are generated to ensure reproducibility of the simulations.

## 2. Run Simulations

Next, the function runs the simulations for the SIR model using the generated parameters and seeds and using epiworldR package:

```{r}
ndays=50
ncores=20
path = "~/epiworldRcalibrate/misc/simulated_data/sir-%06i.rds"
matrices <- run_simulations(N, n, ndays, ncores, theta, seeds, path)
matrices[[1]][1,,] 
```

-   The `run_simulations()` function generates and saves the simulated epidemic trajectories to the specified path.

## 3. Filter Non-Null Data

After running the simulations, the function filters out incomplete or null elements to ensure data quality:

```{r}
filtered_data <- filter_non_null(matrices, theta)
matrices <- filtered_data$matrices
head(matrices[[1]][1,,])
```

```{r}
theta <- filtered_data$theta
N <- filtered_data$N
N
```

N is the number of non null datasets that we could simulate. - `filter_non_null()`: Filters out any null simulations and updates `theta` and `N` accordingly.

## 4. Prepare Data for TensorFlow

To use the simulated data for training, the matrices are prepared and converted into arrays that can be processed by TensorFlow:

```{r}
arrays_1d <- prepare_data_for_tensorflow(matrices, N)
head(arrays_1d[,,1])
# Save theta and simulations data
  theta2 <-as.data.table(copy(theta))
  theta2$crate <- plogis(theta2$crate / 10)
```

-   `prepare_data_for_tensorflow()`: Reshapes the simulated data into the format required for TensorFlow training.

## 5. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance: (our default is to use 70% of the data as train and 30% as test)

```{r}
data_split <- split_data(arrays_1d, theta2, N)
  train <- data_split$train
  test <- data_split$test
```

-   `split_data()`: Splits the data into `train` and `test` sets.

## 6. Build and Train the CNN Model

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built and trained on the simulation data:

```{r}
model <- build_cnn_model(dim(arrays_1d)[-1], ncol(theta))
train_model(model, train)
```

-   `build_cnn_model()`: Builds a CNN model with input dimensions based on the simulation data.
-   `train_model()`: Trains the model using the training dataset.

## 7. Evaluate the Model

Finally, the function evaluates the performance of the trained model on the test data:

```{r}
eval_results <- evaluate_model(model, test, theta)
pred <- eval_results$pred
MAEs <- eval_results$MAEs
```

-   `evaluate_model()`: Evaluates the model's performance and calculates Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs).
-   `pred`: Predictions made by the model.
-   `MAEs`: Mean Absolute Errors between the predicted and actual parameter values.

```{r}
print(head(pred,10))
```

```{r}
print(MAEs)
```

# Conclusion

The `simulate_calibrate_sir` function provides a comprehensive workflow to generate, simulate, and calibrate an SIR model using deep learning. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras to create a powerful calibration model, and it offers valuable insights into how well a CNN can learn the dynamics of a simulated epidemic.

The workflow covers all aspects of data simulation, processing, and model training. By following this vignette, you should be able to understand the full pipeline for simulating and calibrating an SIR model.

Feel free to modify and extend the function based on your specific requirements.

#  Section 2: See the Calibration

After running the simulation and calibration of the SIR model, it is essential to examine the calibration results to understand how well the model performed. The following steps can be taken to see the calibration:

Predict Parameters Using CNN Model: After training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, you can use the calibrate_sir(data) function to predict the parameters of the SIR model based on input data. The data parameter should be a numeric matrix or array containing counts of infected individuals over a period of 30 or 60 days.

```{r}
N=1
n=5000
set.seed(123)
theta <- generate_theta(N, n)
  

  

  path="~/epiworldRcalibrate/misc/simulated_data/sir-%06i.rds"
  # Run simulations
  matrices <- run_simulations(N, n, ndays, ncores, theta,seeds,path)

  # Filter non-null elements
  filtered_data <- filter_non_null(matrices, theta)
  matrices <- filtered_data$matrices
  theta <- filtered_data$theta
  N <- filtered_data$N

  # Prepare data for TensorFlow
  arrays_1d <- prepare_data_for_tensorflow(matrices, N)
arrays_1d <- arrays_1d[,1,,drop=FALSE]
N     <- dim(arrays_1d)[1]

  # Save theta and simulations data
  theta2 <-as.data.table(copy(theta))
  theta2$crate <- plogis(theta2$crate / 10)



```

The output of calibrate_sir will include predicted values such as preval (prevalence), crate (case rate), ptran (transmission probability), and prec (precision).

Evaluate Calibration Accuracy: To evaluate how well the calibration has worked, you can compare the predicted parameters with the true parameters that were used to generate the simulation. You can use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the predictions.

```{r}
# Assuming you have a set of true parameters for comparison
true_params <- c(preval = 0.12, crate = 5, ptran = 0.2, prec = 0.5)
predicted_params <- result$pred

# Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
mae <- mean(abs(true_params - unlist(predicted_params)))
print(paste("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae))
```
